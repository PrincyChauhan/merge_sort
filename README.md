# Merge Sort Algorithm

### Merge sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. 
##### It divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.
##### Here's description of the Merge Sort algorithm:
##### Divide: Divide the unsorted array into two halves, roughly equal in size.
##### Conquer: Recursively sort each of the two halves.
##### Combine: Merge the two sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.
